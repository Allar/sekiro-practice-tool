# sekiro-practice-tool

Just a minimal Sekiro trainer for practicing speedruns. If you need a more complete tool, check out [Jiiks' tool](https://github.com/Jiiks/Sekiro.SpeedrunUtility).

It is a DLL designed to work with [Jiiks' Universal Proxy Chain](https://github.com/Jiiks/UniversalProxyChain). To install it, copy it within the `uclib` directory under the game's folder.


## Electron-based version

In the `electron-amnesiaclapp` branch you can find an earlier version of the tool, based on Electron and my [amnesiaclapp](https://github.com/veeenu/amnesiaclapp) library.
It is unmaintained and to be considered deprecated.
