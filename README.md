# sekiro-practice-tool

Just a minimal Sekiro trainer for practicing speedruns. I made it out of convenience and to experiment with my [amnesiaclapp library](https://github.com/veeenu/amnesiaclapp). If you need a more complete tool, check out [Jiiks' tool](https://github.com/Jiiks/Sekiro.SpeedrunUtility).
